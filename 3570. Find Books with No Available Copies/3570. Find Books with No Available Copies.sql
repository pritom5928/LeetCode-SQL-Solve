Easy

Table: library_books

+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    |
+------------------+---------+
| book_id          | int     |
| title            | varchar |
| author           | varchar |
| genre            | varchar |
| publication_year | int     |
| total_copies     | int     |
+------------------+---------+
book_id is the unique identifier for this table.
Each row contains information about a book in the library, including the total number of copies owned by the library.
Table: borrowing_records

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| record_id     | int     |
| book_id       | int     |
| borrower_name | varchar |
| borrow_date   | date    |
| return_date   | date    |
+---------------+---------+
record_id is the unique identifier for this table.
Each row represents a borrowing transaction and return_date is NULL if the book is currently borrowed and hasnot been returned yet.
Write a solution to find all books that are currently borrowed (not returned) and have zero copies available in the library.

A book is considered currently borrowed if there exists a borrowing record with a NULL return_date
Return the result table ordered by current borrowers in descending order, then by book title in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

Explanation:

The Great Gatsby (book_id = 1):
Total copies: 3
Currently borrowed by Alice Smith, Bob Johnson, and Grace Miller (3 borrowers)
Available copies: 3 - 3 = 0
Included because available_copies = 0
1984 (book_id = 3):
Total copies: 1
Currently borrowed by David Brown (1 borrower)
Available copies: 1 - 1 = 0
Included because available_copies = 0
Books not included:
To Kill a Mockingbird (book_id = 2): Total copies = 3, current borrowers = 2, available = 1
Pride and Prejudice (book_id = 4): Total copies = 2, current borrowers = 1, available = 1
The Catcher in the Rye (book_id = 5): Total copies = 1, current borrowers = 0, available = 1
Brave New World (book_id = 6): Total copies = 4, current borrowers = 1, available = 3
Result ordering:
The Great Gatsby appears first with 3 current borrowers
1984 appears second with 1 current borrower
Output table is ordered by current_borrowers in descending order, then by book_title in ascending order.

1. Solution with CTE (aggregate non-returned copies, then join) with runtime 518ms beats 90.24%:
 
 - Time complexity: O(B log B + R) => R = rows scanned/grouped in borrowing_records for the CTE, B = rows in library_books, B log B from the final ORDER BY
 - Space complexity: O(B + R) => CTE result holds up to R grouped rows, join/output holds up to B rows
 
WITH non_returned_copies AS (
	SELECT 
		book_id,
        COUNT(1) AS Total_non_returned_copies
	FROM borrowing_records 
    WHERE return_date IS NULL
    GROUP BY book_id
)
SELECT
	lb.book_id,
	lb.title,
    lb.author,
    lb.genre,

FROM library_books lb 
JOIN non_returned_copies nrc ON lb.book_id = nrc.book_id
WHERE lb.total_copies = nrc.Total_non_returned_copies
ORDER BY current_borrowers DESC, lb.title ASC;

2. Solution with Correlated sub-query with runtime 606ms beats 44.04%:
 
 - Time complexity: O(B * R) => B = rows in library_books, R = rows in borrowing_records; the correlated subquery re-scans borrowing_records for every row of library_books
 - Space complexity: O(B) => output holds up to B matching rows, subquery itself uses O(1) extra space per call
